This project is a contribution from my commercial works in to the flash open source community. This player can be used to playback simple p2p multicast streams using simpleNetgroups + GroupSpecifier or Netgroups + GroupSpecifier.

Configuration parameters can be used to provide rtmfp url, group name, stream name, private or not (private groups use netgroups). More info can be found in docs
